What the rooftop-potential map is doing
Step	What happens under the hood	Why it matters
1 — Re-project the data	The building-roof shapefile is re-projected to EPSG 3857 (Web-Mercator).	So distances/areas are in meters and the polygons line up with the base-map tiles.
2 — Grab key fields	The script auto-detects columns that hold slope (roof pitch) and aspect (azimuth⁠/⁠orientation).	Pitch and orientation are the two biggest geometric drivers of solar output.
3 — Classify potential	Each roof face is run through classify():
• High = slope 25–35 ° and aspect 150–210 ° (i.e., south-facing, near-optimal tilt)
• Medium = slope 15–25 ° and aspect 120–240 ° (still decent)
• everything else → Low.	Gives an instant “good / OK / poor” quality flag that investors and planners can act on.
4 — Render the map	Polygons are plotted with geopandas using the Potential field as the colour; a light CartoDB Positron basemap is added via contextily.	High/Medium/Low zones pop out visually, and the basemap provides street-level context.
5 — Compute KPIs	For each potential class the script sums PvArea (m²) and, if energy data are present, calculates average kWh per m².	Quantifies how much good roof area exists and how productive it could be.
6 — (If dates + energy) Forecast	Where year or date info exists, annual energy totals per class are modelled with Holt-Winters exponential smoothing, projecting 5 years ahead.	Shows the expected growth curve of rooftop generation for strategic planning.
Practical insights you can pull from the map
•	Investment targeting – Clusters of High roofs highlight neighbourhoods with the quickest pay-back for rooftop PV.
•	Policy design – If Low dominates, you might explore vertical PV, façade solutions, or incentives for structural roof adjustments.
•	Grid impact – Dense patches of High/Medium potential can flag where voltage-rise mitigation (storage, smart inverters) will be needed as adoption ramps up.
